## Current Status

All required database attributes have been added and are now available. The band generation should now work without database errors.

## Remaining Setup

### CORS Configuration (Manual Step Required)
You still need to add the Netlify domain to Appwrite:

1. Go to Appwrite Console (https://cloud.appwrite.io)
2. Select the "flexos" project
3. Navigate to Settings → Platforms
4. Add a new Web App platform:
   - Name: Mitchly Music (Production)
   - Hostname: `mitchlymusic.netlify.app`

### Environment Variables for Image Generation
To enable image generation, add this to Netlify:
- `FAL_API_KEY=your_fal_api_key_here`

## Testing
After the CORS setup, the app should:
1. Generate bands without database errors ✅
2. Save to Appwrite successfully (once CORS is configured)
3. Generate images (once FAL_API_KEY is added)
